TAMS (TA Management System) Presentation

## ⭐️ Overview
The TA Management System (TAMS) project aims to enhance the user interface (UI) and experience for Teaching Assistants (TAs) applying for jobs at the University of Ottawa. This project stems from a validation interview with a TA, focusing on proposed UI improvements to better meet their needs and streamline the application process.

## 🍳 Validation
A validation interview with a TA was conducted to gather feedback and identify improvements. During the interview, we discussed their current use of the system, pinpointed issues, and collected suggestions for enhancements. Based on their input, a prototype was developed to better align the system with their needs and preferences.
